                            Interested in how I get things done? It's quite simple, really. In fact,
                            it's super important that it is simple because I still have seven classes as a
                            high school student to keep on top of!

                            When I finish a page, I save one version as a .procreate file, and another
                            as a JPEG. The JPEG gets uploaded to my DropBox account, where I then get a link
                            that I can put in the src area. This is a super great way of storing images because
                            then I don't have to deal with directories and all that folder stuff with all the
                            backslashes. And if I have any page edits to make, I can easily upload a new file that will
                            automatically load on the website (not like you can't do this with HTML, but still a plus)!

                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">To be honest, this is a whole lot of steps
                              lumped into one. Initially, I did a rudimentary "concept outline" on actual paper
                              for almost every single page up to Page 34, when I realized that my outlines
                              were taking up a lot of space in my math notebook. Now, my tree-saving plan is to do
                              them electronically. It's double the work in the end to ink on top of
                              the outlines, but really, it's proven a useful technique. And I think it's
                              a really common idea in the art world to do outlines. Honestly, my outlines
                              are really basic. That's why I didn't include them here. You are going to cringe
                              <strong><em>so</em></strong> hard, my friend, if you get a peek at those outlines.
                              My electronic outlines? I've deleted them. The ones I currently have on paper
                              that are just sitting in my math notebook? I'm thinking of burning them. LOL</p>
                              <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">When I'm inking, I do the panels first. I don't
                              download my panels from anywhere or have access to a professional panel-making
                              thingamajig. I just draw lines and rely on Drawing Assist. A legit life-saver.
                              My hands are so shaky, it's unbelievable. The reason why I specifically chose
                              this panel is because it contains elements that poke out of the little frame
                              itself. I use two layers in this case: one for the frame and one for the subjects.
                              Then I merge them after erasing some of the frame where the hair protrudes.

                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">This is the part where continuity is most important to me.
                              In fact, colors are usually harder to keep consistent than the actual outlines, especially
                              with this glitch I have where somehow saturation increases without me doing anything!
                              </p>
                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">How do I keep things consistent? The app I use for the entire
                              process, Procreate, allows me to create a customized color palette into which I input
                              all the hair, clothing, etc. colors. Now, the actual coloring is quite simple. I do
                              create separate layers named Skin, Hair, Clothing, Accessories, Wall, Floor, and Props.
                              This is super useful for the next step so that effects don't spill onto unnecessary parts
                              of the drawing. For example, if I'm not careful and I shade Dorothea's really fluffy hair,
                              I could end up shading the wall. Which would look unprofessional.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">And how do I avoid the dreaded <strong><em>white spaces</em></strong>? To be honest, I don't have
                              a technique for that other than "if I don't find it now, I'll find it later, and if I
                              don't find it later, I'll cross my fingers and hope no one else does."

                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">Shading is what I do for depth. The brush I use is called Soft Airbrush.
                              I don't even adjust the settings on the brushes in fear of making an elementary mistake and jeopardizing
                              the brush's effect forever. I'm sure I'll learn how to tweak stuff! I do this step before the lower-opacity
                              shading because it gives me an idea of what kind of lighting I'm expecting. Usually, there's a lamp
                              or a window that's acting as the obvious light source, so I use the placement of the light source
                              relative to the subject or object I'm shading to decide how to go about things. The light source
                              in this example is the window to their left, which is letting a ton of sun stream in, hitting both characters
                              on their left side.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">Airbrushing is also where the SHCAWFP layers from Step #2 come in handy!
                              Take Valentine's hair. It's blue on the bottom. In order to make it blue on the bottom, I needed
                              to hairbrush it. Most gradients in my comic pages are a result of airbrushing, actually. So, first I go
                              to the Hair layer, and I make a new layer. Then, I press the Clipping Mask option, and anything I do stays
                              within the hair coloring, and does not bleed over to the face. When I merge the clipped mask and the original
                              layer, it stays like that! That's such a cool thing! I love technology.

                            <h4 class="text-white"><strong>Step #4: Opacity Shading</strong></h4>
                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">Opacity shading is part of the artstyle I use. Also it's just a really nice effect.
                              And even more importantly, I feel validated every time I finish opacity shading because this is something I
                              do manually. To every. Single. Layer. Really, it's not as daunting a process as it seemed at first, though
                              one must have a lot of patience.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">What I do, usually, is get the same brush I drew the main outline with (in my case,
                              the Technical Pen) and then decrease the opacity to a range of 17-20%. Seldomly I will increase the opacity if
                              I'm trying to make a light-colored subject or object brighter. Mostly, I don't really put any thought into the
                              actual color of the opacity shading. If I'm shading light, I use white. If I'm shading dark, I use black.
                              I do go against the simplicity in some scenes. Examples from Chapter One: the yellow in <a href="https://valentinecomic.github.io/21.html">Cassandra's laboratory<a> and the blue in
                              <a href="https://valentinecomic.github.io/27.html">Sector Nine</a>, due to the unique lighting.

                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">For the dialogue bubbles, I draw them with the thinnest possible
                              brush. I use the Predictive Stroke quality for the circles because I cannot draw an aesthetically
                              pleasing circle for my life. As for the connections between circles, that cannot be done with
                              Predictive Stroke. Essentially, I rely on myself to draw a cool enough curve. This curve takes at
                              least four tries to get correct. Then, I duplicate the layer with the curve and just move it a little
                              to the right. This makes a perfect tube-like shape, preventing me having to scream in anger as I draw a non-identical
                              curve for the umpteenth time.

                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">You might be yelling at me in your mind, wondering why
                              the heck I spent all that time drawing the stuff I clearly knew was going to be under
                              the dialogue bubbles. Mainly, this is an insurance policy. If I suddenly think of a line that I
                              totally want to change, I have the flexibility to do so without having to redraw anything.
                              Just edit the layer with the dialogue bubbles, save as a JPEG, and I'm done.

                            <p class="text-white-50 mb-3">So, yes, this does mean I have a version of all my comic pages
                              without dialogue bubbles! If you have a particular one you'd like to see, ask me and I'll put it in the
                              Gallery.
