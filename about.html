                                    <div class="medium text-white-50 mb-3">Special Operative Juniper James Valentine
                                      landed on Earth in 1947 with absolutely no knowledge of his past.
                                      However, he regards this as more of a clean slate than a tragic loss.
                                      Unfortunately, premonitions and hallucinations taunt him into
                                      thinking his aura is innately corrupt, despite the consolation of his fellow
                                      people at the Supernatural Assembly (better known as the Assocation)
                                      that he is a vessel of pureblooded light magic!</div>
                                    <div class="medium text-white-50 mb-3">Fast forward eighty years, James has
                                      experienced a lot of what Earth has to offer, while still
                                      being a quiet member of society. In fact, he is so reserved that he has
                                      avoided relationships and work commitments. An honorable and intelligent man who does not mind not knowing
                                      who he was in the past, James lives a self-satisfied life, even taking pride in
                                      his low-profile identity. But a sudden accident paves the way for darkness
                                      to return to his soul, threatening to undo the mien of normalcy that James
                                      has been keeping up for so long. This new, unwelcome magic within him proves to be so conniving and malevolent
                                      that James quickly realizes he cannot fight it alone.
                                      </div>
                                    <div class="medium text-white-50">Though reluctant, James must accept the aid
                                      of a group of detached students of the Association. However, the more hands that are outstretched
                                      toward him, the more deception he faces. In a world where one doesn't know who to
                                      trust, will James ever find his way out of his internal dilemma? Filled with
                                      altercations between longtime acquaintances, magical battles, and a constantly
                                      morphing definition of the difference between right and wrong, there is never a dull
                                      moment in the life of S.O. Valentine.</div>

                                              Like that Leslie Knope credits scene. Not that I intended to work alone, (I'm not Batman, and even Batman has Alfred.) but that's
                                              sort of how it went. I do credit the website template to Start Bootstrap's <em><strong>Grayscale</em></strong>.

                                               Planning to major in biology or physiology, I also like watermelons and shirts with collars on them. My great fondness for uniforms arose from that idyll called middle school, where
                                               they brainwashed me into believing that uniform clothing was <strong><em>the</em></strong> solution to life. Defiant I was, and from
                                               an elementary school with sartorial freedom, yet they hushed me.

                                               eliminate the characteristic teenage struggle of contrast. No more competition, no more conflict, no need to fret about

                                               yourself to the arduous task of decision-making? Why set your own priorities when they will only have to be corrected later in life?
